            <p>
                My name's Karina Karanadze if you haven't noticed. I used to be a velodrome champion and now I'm learning how to code in my free time. I love cooking and spending all my free time with my parents. I was born in 2004, October 17. My goal is to be really good at coding and maybe eventually make my own game to make it sucessful just like games like minecraft
